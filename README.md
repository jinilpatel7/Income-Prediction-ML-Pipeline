# Income-Prediction-ML-Pipeline
End-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting whether an adult earns more or less than $50K/year using census income data.

# Income Prediction ML Pipeline

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 using census data. It demonstrates the full lifecycle of a data science projectâ€”from setting up the environment, implementing logging and custom exception handling, data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and finally building training and prediction pipelines. The solution includes production-ready components and serves as a strong foundation for scalable ML deployments.
